"""Audit which commits on main the Main Releasability Gate actually evaluated.

The gate is dispatched per merged pull request; this repository merges by
rebase, so a pull request holding N commits puts N on main and every one of
them must have a gate run - a commit that was never head becomes the deployed
tree on rollback and bisect. A run that is never created is not a failure, so
nothing else reports the loss; this audit does.

Fail-closed by design (a watchdog that can pass while verifying nothing is
the same liveness defect it exists to catch):

- a missing ``gh`` binary is a failure under ``--fail-on-gap``, never a skip;
- a commit whose run listing cannot be fetched (rate limit, token scope,
  transient API failure) is UNKNOWN, and unknown commits fail the audit under
  ``--fail-on-gap`` - they are unverified, not implicitly fine;
- only runs that reached a verdict (success or failure) count as evaluation:
  a run cancelled seconds after dispatch evaluated nothing. In-progress runs
  count as pending (unknown), not as coverage.
