"""Guards for per-commit main-gate coverage (found by cross-repo review, 2026-08-31).

This repository merges by rebase, so a merged PR of N commits puts N commits
on main. The dispatcher previously named only ``merge_commit_sha`` - the
other N-1 commits had no releasability run, invisibly, because a run that is
never created is not a failure (risk#260; the class was measured across the
estate and fixed first in lotus-render#174, reference variant
lotus-report#221). These tests pin the two halves of the fix: the dispatcher
enumerates every merged revision, and the daily audit fails closed rather
than passing while verifying nothing.

    `pull_request.commits` counts the branch when the event fired. A rebase that

    landed, and `rev-list -n COUNT` then walks past the PR into commits earlier
